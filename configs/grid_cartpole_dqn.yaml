# Path: configs/grid_cartpole_dqn.yaml
# Purpose: W&B Sweep config (Grid) for sensitivity analysis; used by W&B (not parsed like the default runtime config).

program: scripts/step4_cartpole_sensitivity_analysis.py # Main script path
method: grid

metric:
  name: final_mean # Metric logged via wandb.log; must be a single metric; here it is mean return after evaluation
  goal: maximize   # Grid search enumerates all values; goal is still useful for W&B visualizations (e.g., ranking)
